My plan was to use Snagit for my iteration because I couldn't figure out how to commit my work to gothub, but I just figured out how to do it and rather than paying for snagit id rather just use the github commits. I'm going to include markdown comments for this assignment to explain what I did but for future assignments I will include all my steps as commits on github. "
